Hi i am Brian Johnson, I have a honours degree in mechanical engineering. However i want to make the switch over to cyber security or software engineering. I love solving problems and have a thirst for knowledge. I have taken it upon myself to learn some basic coding using markup languages HTML and CSS. I found a skills bootcamp in cyber security and software engineering at the universty of central lancashire, in which i completed in December 2023. During the skills bootcamp i learnt many skills including:
C#,.Net, version control, Git, VS Code, Secure code review, Entity Framworks, REST API, Applied Cryptography and Secrets Management.

I am open to contribute to open source projects, with some guidence. I am looking for a career change, and i am hoping to secure a job in cyber security or software engineering, and willing to start at the very bottom.

Some people may not think that this is fun at all, but i really enjoyed it.  I built a wind tunnel, and designed my own experiment which could be used on the wind tunnel to collect data. I also Hacked the game cyber Kings, which was designed by BAE systems.
